            <p class="lead">Version Content System (VCS) is one main repository for all the project files where teammates can check files make changes, and check them back in. An example of a VSC is Github.  It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, merge changes to the same file, and more. The benefits of a VCS is that files cannot be overwritten, people can work in a common repository from different locations simultaneously without any conflict, and you can access your files and share you work with other from anywhere.</p>

            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. It’s a version of your project that are hosted on the internet or network. You push and pull data to and from the remote repository to share your work and collaborate with others over the net. You can show remotes, add remotes, fetch and pull from your remotes, push to your remotes, inspect you remotes, remove your remotes, and rename your remotes. For example, if I wanted to rename my remote “jay” to “jayla” I can run “git remote rename jay Jayla”</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git status shows all the files that were changed since the last back up and which ones are already added to the staging area. To summarize, you use the git status command to check the current state of the repository. It will report that there’s nothing to commit when the current state of the working directory has no changes to record. It can also display the state of the working directory and the staging area, but this command does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. For example, if there hasn’t been any changes in the file hellworld since the last time I checked the status, git status would display the message “ # nothing to commit (working directory clean).</p>

            <p class="lead">Git is a verson control system. It is a free and open source distributed version control system. This system is designed to handle small and large groups, allowing each user to have a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their own machine. Git has speed efficiency and it prevents unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Git drives the website that we are all on right now. Many projects share their codebase with the world in a git repository including, but not limiting, google chrome and firefox. Git serves as the foundation for the many services like Github. Also, you Git is not only use for to share code with others, you can use Git in the privacy of your own business or home.</p>

            <p class="lead">Github is a website and a service where people share, take ideas from, and use other developers codes and projects from around the world. The “Git” in Github is a version control system, and the “hub” stands for a service that serves as a website where developers their projects with other developers such as their selves. Github is ideal for programmers, but github can also be used for many other types of files, even though it is more commonly used for developers. Github has gained this title over the years and is now known as the worlds’ leading software development platform.</p>
